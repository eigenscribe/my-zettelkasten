# Definition

A **metric space** is a pair $(X, d)$ where $X$ is a set and $d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a *metric* (distance function).

## Metric Axioms

For all $x, y, z \in X$:

1. $d(x, y) \geq 0$ (non-negativity)
2. $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$ (identity of indiscernibles)
3. $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ (symmetry)
4. $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ (triangle inequality)

$$
d: X \times X \to [0, \infty)
$$

## Connection to Topology

Every metric space is a [[Introduction to Topology|topological space]] with topology generated by open balls:

$$
B(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) < r\}
$$

This is called the **metric topology**.

## Examples

- $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $d(x, y) = \|x - y\|$ (Euclidean metric)
- Any set with $d(x, y) = \begin{cases} 0 & x = y \\ 1 & x \neq y \end{cases}$ (discrete metric)

> [!tip] Remember
> Not every topological space comes from a metric! See metrizability conditions.
